# MobileDropdown
Phase 2
    - Removed Margin from nav ul
    - Changed Responsive Media Queries 
        > from max-width: 768px to max-width: 480px 
        > from min-width: 769px to min-width: 481px
    - Added a container class inside the 480px media query
    - Removed padding-left from nav li
    - Added a topbar-container class
        > To differentiate between the ul and nav-mobile
            > because I want the list of links (ul) to be 100% wide
            > while I want the topbar to be contained within 420px (on mobile)
    - Removed section width 100vw

Phase 3 - Adding FlexBox Techniques
